# Mod

## Introduction

This section will guide you step by step through the process of turning your Nintendo Wii into a modded console. While this guide covers each step in a decent amount of detail, some parts that involve simple tasks—like locating your Wii’s date and time settings or finding the version number—are not elaborated on as they are straightforward. I've written this guide for people who have a basic level of technological understanding. If you’re comfortable navigating menus and logically know where things might be found, or if you don’t mind a quick Google search for more minor details, you'll be just fine.

However, if you don’t have a solid grasp of basic tech concepts, modding your Wii may not be the best option. If something goes wrong or needs attention, troubleshooting without a basic understanding could be frustrating. Having some foundational knowledge will not only make the process smoother but also help you effectively search for solutions when issues arise. Understanding the basics will set you up for success and ensure you enjoy the experience.

## Equipment

You will need:

* Nintendo Wii
* 2TB External Hard Drive (preferably with external power)
* SanDisk Ultra 256GB SDHC SDXC UHS-I Memory Card

## Prerequisites

1. Set the correct date and time in the consoles settings.
2. Connect your console to the Internet.
3. Update your console to the latest version (if it isn't already).
4. Make note of your Wii's version. It will be 4.3U, 4.3E, 4.3J or 4.3K depending on your consoles region.
5. Make note of your console's MAC Address.

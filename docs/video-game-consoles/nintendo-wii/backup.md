# Backup

## Introduction

This section will guide you through **backing up** the data on your SD Card and External HDD.&#x20;

Should anything happen to your console, SD Card, or External HDD, having backups in place will make it simple to restore everything to the way it was. Youâ€™ll learn how to properly backup both storage devices, ensuring you can quickly recover your games, saves, and homebrew applications with minimal hassle.

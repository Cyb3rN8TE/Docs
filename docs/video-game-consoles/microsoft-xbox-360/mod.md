# Mod

## Introduction

This section will guide you step by step through the process of turning your Xbox 360 into a modded console. I've written this guide for people who have a basic level of technological understanding. If you're comfortable navigating menus, finding system information, or using Google for smaller details, you should have no trouble following along.

However, if you're not familiar with basic tech concepts, modding your Xbox 360 might not be the best choice. If something goes wrong, troubleshooting without this foundational knowledge could be frustrating. Having a basic understanding of how your console works will not only make the process smoother but also help you effectively search for solutions when issues arise. Understanding the fundamentals will set you up for success and ensure you enjoy the modding experience.

## Goals

* Play Microsoft Xbox 360 backups from an external HDD and/or internal HDD.
* Play Microsoft Xbox backups from an external HDD and/or internal HDD.

{% hint style="info" %}
Backups refer to file-level copies of games that you have lawfully purchased and already own, either digitally or on physical media such as a CD, DVD, floppy disk, cartridge, etc.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is both illegal and unethical to pirate or obtain games that you have not purchased or do not own a legitimate physical or digital copy of. This guide is intended solely to help you modify your console so you can back up and play games you already own. I do not endorse or support any form of software piracy.

By following this guide, you assume full responsibility for your actions. I will not be held liable for any legal issues or consequences that may arise should you choose to engage in piracy or any other illegal activity. Always respect copyright laws and the intellectual property of game developers.
